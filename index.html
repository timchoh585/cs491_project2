        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          For the second project of the AR/VR class, we were asked to build a viewable solar system 
          with the tool Unity3D.  For this project, we were tasked to create a visual representation 
          of different solar systems from data that we collected from a variety of given resources 
          given to us by Professor Andy Johnson.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          The navigation is through the VR controllers.  The navigation includes being able to walk 
          around in the space as well as being able to move the camera with the controls.  Currently, 
          no teleportation is in place because of the limiation of an unbounded area of which is 
          displaying all of the planets and their paths.  If we created a 'box' where the users have 
          to stay in, then having teleportation would have worked, but because the size and space 
          required to show all the planets and their orbits, it would not be a very effective system 
          on allowing the user to teleport because of an infinite depth into space.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          Some features that the project includes is that we created a menu system where you can adjust 
          various details about the view you're looking at.  When first loaded in, you are brought to a 
          view where the system is in a three-dimensional view.  We chose this to be the default view 
          because it is more visually appealing to be a part of the system than to just look at it from 
          the side view.  But to show the side view, we have a two-dimensional view that allows the 
          system to be viewed from a sideways perspective.  So, if the user is just trying to view the 
          system from a whole, it would be fast to understand the distances between the sun and the planets 
          from a two-dimensional view than from a three-dimensional view.  We also allow the user to be 
          able to scale the system.  We did this because it allows a user to get a more broad view of the 
          system as well as a more close-up view of the system.  Having the user choose which way they 
          want to view the system allows for a better learning experience.  We also allow users to change 
        </p>

          We also allow the user to be able to scale the system.  We did this because it allows a user 
          to get a more broad view of the system as well as a more close-up view of the system.  Having 
          the user choose which way they want to view the system allows for a better learning experience.  
          We also allow users to change the speed of the systems as well.  This was to also allow for a 
          better learning experience.  Being able to see a full rotation of a planet's revolution around 
          the sun in respect to other planet's revolutions around the same sun shows how slow, or fast, a 
          planet is moving is not only cool to see, but it allows a user to undertand different gravitational 
          pulls between different suns and different planets.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;" >    
          All of the adjustable features are in a menu that the user can pull up from the controllers that 
          are included with VR sets and that allows for a versatility of users from the plethora of 
          different VR systems out there.
